To run in dev mode:
1. call "ipconfig" to get the ip under wireless section
2. call "set REACT_NATIVE_PACKAGER_HOSTNAME=192.168.0.101" if the ip is 192.168.0.101
3. call "npm start"


To build:
call "exp build:android"


Difficulties:
1. expo is laggy and crashes all the time
2. keep getting errors about SDK tools not installed
